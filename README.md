# React Sample Project

This project is designed to assess your current abilities as a React engineer for Universe. When you're finished, send your project our way.

### Guidelines
=
Using this sample backend, we want to produce an app that starts on a screen of posts where each cell has the title and body visible. Like a boring Twitter clone. You can use this API to pull those posts: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts.

Clicking on a post should show a new screen that is like a detail screen for that post. It can include comments for that post from this route https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1/comments (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts). 

These screens can be nested as much as you want. For example click on a post, click on more posts by that author, click on a post, etc.

Thats it as far as guidelines. They are purposely vague because we'd like to see what you build for a simple app. In order to keep you from going overboard with architectures or custom UI, we recommend limiting yourself to 2-4 hours.

### Things We're Looking For

- Code well separated into reusable components. You can use any architecture pattern you want as long as you can explain it to us. Don't feel the need to over architect this, it is a simple app, but your code should be clean and maintainable.
- An understanding of when to use a library or dependency versus building components from scratch. Using dependencies is fine as long as you can speak to why it was the right choice.
- Use of modern Javascript and React patterns.
